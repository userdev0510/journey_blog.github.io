== SEO Optimized & Responsive Social Share & Follow Icons ==

Having a responsive website means that it works on all devices such as tablets, iPhone, Android phones and desktop computers. Responsiveness matters, it has a huge impact on how you rank in search engines such as Google and Bing. Not all plugins that provide social share buttons and social share icons are responsive or SEO optimized. There isn't much to optimize beside making them W3C valid, you can't add schema or other types of microdata to make such a module SEO friendly. 

Our WordPress plugin is fully responsive and works with AMP, CDN (such as Cloudflare) & SSL (HTTPS websites) as well We know how important it is for monetization in the digital world to have an SEO-friendly website – especially if you rely on AdSense, ads or affiliate programs to earn your money. When Google releases and SEO updates then we'll read it and take action if any changes are needed to keep this plugin SEO optimised.


== Simple To Use ==

This plugin impresses with its simplicity. I can hardly believe that anyone will get stuck when using it. All you have to do is to install it, go to its settings, paste the social media links you want, and tick the activate checkbox. Could it be any simpler than that?

== Plenty of Social Networks == 

You are probably active on Facebook and Twitter, and some of you may use Pinterest and LinkedIn too. However, neglecting other social networks isn’t always a smart decision. You have to be present where your audience is present. 

It’s totally up to you to decide which bookmarking services & social networks are suitable for your business. Regardless of your choice, Superb Social Media Share and Follow Buttons lets you engage with your readers on countless social networks. YouTube, Instagram, Snapchat, Tumblr, Reddit, Twitch, and Behance are all available with this plugin.

== Vertical Floating Share And Follow Bar == 

Having a floating social share / follow bar on either the left or right side of a website has become popular, especially for bloggers and news websites. Because of that we've of course integrated that in our plugin as well! We are still working on a horizontal floating share & follow bar design. Having a floating follow bar with a follower count is great for website integrity and showing how popular your website is. 

The floating follow sidebar is sticky and loads fast, so your users will see it right away. You can choose to use our custom designs or the native social sharing buttons that the social networks have. 

If you got ideas for how we can improve our floating share and follow buttons feature then let us know through the support channel or email!
